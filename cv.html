      <h3>Movinga - Vice President, Software Engineering</h3>
      <p>Movinga is a marketplace which connects people moving home with relocation companies. Operating in a mutually beneficial way - by helping small relocation companies with customer service and marketing, and by helping customers find reliable home movers and insurance providers - Movinga has enjoyed solid growth in its two key markets of Germany and France, and recently entered the Swedish market.</p>
      <p>Joining a small engineering team with a lot of legacy software to look after, I was given the remit to expand the team while changing its culture - to be more collaborative, diverse, inclusive, and communicative.</p>
      <p><strong>Key achievements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>In a short span of time, expanded the engineering organization from 8 to 16 developers, while improving its gender ratio from 7:1 men/non-men to 11:5.</li>
        <li>Put team leads and a two-tier reporting structure in place to facilitate this expansion, and further expansion in the future.</li>
        <li>Developed a framework for aiding in the career progression and assessment of developers, along with a peer and manager feedback process to support it.</li>
        <li>Kicked off and occasionally contributed to an effort to describe all Movinga's infrastructure in Terraform and Ansible.</li>
        <li>As part of this infrastructure description effort, oversaw efforts to simplify the infrastructure, leading to a 50% reduction in hosting costs.</li>
        <li>Along with the Head of Product, developed a process for high-level planning which brought business stakeholders and the technology organization into closer alignment and led to faster iteration.</li>
        <li>Oversaw the integration of various technologies acquired from our erstwhile competitor, Move24.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>SoundCloud - Tech Lead</h3>
      <p>During my time at SoundCloud, I became increasingly interested in fixing technical and process problems affecting multiple teams. I was able to work on some of these when I stepped into the "Tech Lead" role. Unlike a tech lead at many other companies, I worked with multiple teams to oversee and guide the technical quality of what they were delivering, as well as collaborating with other technical leads and the engineering leadership to initiate and guide projects to improve SoundCloud's technical landscape across the board.</p>
      <p><strong>Key achievements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Proposed and helped implement changes to the emergency on-call system for engineers, leading to a 50% cost saving and increased job satisfaction from engineers in the employee survey.</li> 
        <li>Convened and moderated the tech leadership forum - a process and regular meeting for escalating cross-cutting technical issues or opportunities, and scheduling work in those areas.</li>
        <li>Produced architectural guidance for microservice authors - how and when to apply authorization filters, how to identify opportunities to extract parts of the monolith to microservices, how to develop a testing strategy.</li>
        <li>Produced and delivered a workshop on the topic of workflow improvement. Suggested concrete improvements to SoundCloud's product development process.</li>
      </ul>
