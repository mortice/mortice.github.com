<p>
see something good<br />
twist<br />
turn<br />
something good<br />
</p>

<p>
a toy, a tool, a tube<br />
a navigator's aid<br />
a guide<br />
</p>

<p>
you were inside<br />
or i thought you were<br />
or we both were<br />
then that moment, tangible<br />
refracted and distant<br />
went with a turn of the wrist<br />
a look in the eye<br />
a turn of phrase<br />
a look away<br />
</p>

<p>
can i plot my way?<br />
by the stars, the shapes, the signs<br />
that we build inside?<br />
</p>

<p>
see something good<br />
a new way<br />
an old way<br />
a tool, a toy<br />
</p>
