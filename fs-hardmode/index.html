                Around the world in a Cessna 152
            </h2>
            <section id="description">
                <p>I'm using Microsoft Flight Simulator to visit every world capital* in the most basic and slowest aircraft in the game which isn't amphibious or designed for rough landings: The Cessna 152.</p>
                <p>The Cessna 152 has a cruising speed of 107 knots and a range of 415 nautical miles. Those are not big numbers, so this will be <strong>hard</strong> and take a <strong>while</strong>.</p>
                <p>Since I have only the most basic clue about how to fly a plane, this will be <strong>hard</strong> and take a <strong>while</strong>.
                <p>To make this harder/more realistic/fun, there are the following extra rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No GPS (or any other tool or instrument that doesn't appear in the plane's cockpit).</li>
                    <li>Maps that do not show the plane's location are allowed.</li>
                    <li>No assistance turned on within Flight Simulator - with the exception of taxi ribbon**.</li>
                    <li>No AI control allowed.</li>
                    <li>Outside cockpit view can only be used for sightseeing/entertainment purposes - no manoeuvering while in this view.</li>
                    <li>If I crash, the flight must restart from the last place I was safely on the ground.</li>
                    <li>If I have to land outside an airfield, the next flight must start from the nearest airfield, land where I landed, and then resume.</li>
                    <li>Each flight must begin where the last flight ended, with the aircraft's engine off.</li>
                    <li>Did I mention I don't know how to fly a plane?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="note">* What's a 'world capital'? Good question. It's not as simple as getting a list of all countries and getting their capital cities, because a) what's a country; b) some countries have no capital, some have multiple, some share a capital. Life is complicated. It's basically impossible to make a decision here without taking multiple political stances. Since I have even less of a clue about what stances to take than I do about how to fly a plane, I'm outsourcing it to Wikipedia and visiting every place listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_capitals">here</a>.</a></p>
                <p class="note">** Taxi ribbon is turned on because the alternative would be to load up and print out diagrams of every airport in the world that I intend to land at, and I'm trying to have <strong>some</strong> fun here.</p>
                <p>You can watch me try to do this on <a href="https://twitch.tv/rentalcustard">Twitch</a>. I'll announce upcoming streams on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rentalcustard">Twitter</a>.</p>
